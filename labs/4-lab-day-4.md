## IoT Lab | Day four
This is an MQTT's day. MQTT stands for "Message Queue Telemetry Transport". This is a publish-subscribe-based "lightweight" messaging protocol. 

In this fourth lab session, our main objective is to harness the full potential of MQTT in many different architectural configurations and setups; with publishers, suscribers and brokers embedded in IoT devices, Raspberry Pis, or online sandboxes.
